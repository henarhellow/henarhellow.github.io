description of project
example: This project uses Python to demonstrate the steps for 
preparing a dataset with multiple variables and data types, and 
then selecting the appropriate features that contribute to a 
specific outcome; in this case, hospital length of stay.

The dataset contains about 32,000 records with data consisting 
of patient demographics, diagnoses, medical history, and vital 
signs. This data is fictitious, but represents true clinical 
outcomes and values.
